    "# Notebook 04: Main Prompt Optimization Using Optimized Judge\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 **Overview**\n",
    "This notebook optimizes the **response generation model** using the **optimized judge from Notebook 03** as the evaluation metric. It trains a generator (GPT-3.5-turbo) to produce better customer support responses by using DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer guided by our reliable Gemini judge that mimics Claude 4.5 Sonnet's expert evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 **Complete Workflow with Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing our flight booking example from Notebooks 00-03, let's see how the entire pipeline comes together for **end-to-end optimization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Starting Point (from Notebook 03)**\n",
    "We begin with the **optimized Gemini judge** that now accurately evaluates customer support quality (85% accuracy vs Claude's expert labels):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimized Judge Available:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "optimized_judge = load(\"dspy_modules/optimized_llm_judge\")\n",
    "# This judge now correctly identifies when customers are satisfied\n",
    "# Matches Claude 4.5 Sonnet's expert evaluation 85% of the time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Challenge: Poor Response Generation**\n",
    "Our baseline generator (GPT-3.5-turbo) often produces responses that the optimized judge rates as unsatisfactory:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baseline Generator Performance:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Input: Customer support conversation needing response\n",
    "conversation = '''Company: Southwest Airlines\n",
    "Transcript so far: Customer: i just booked my flight and i have received a email but im not sure if it went through or not, i cant go to the web site and see my itinerary\n",
    "Agent: Hello! I understand your concern about your flight booking. Let me help you verify your reservation.\n",
    "Customer: The email just says payment received with an order number, no confirmation code'''\n",
    "\n",
    "# Baseline GPT-3.5-turbo Response (before optimization)\n",
    "baseline_response = '''Agent: I can help you check your booking status. Can you please provide me with your booking reference number or the email address you used for the reservation? I'll look into this for you.'''\n",
    "\n",
    "# Optimized Judge Evaluation (using judge from Notebook 03)\n",
    "judge_evaluation = {\n",
    "  'reasoning': \"The agent asked for information to help but didn't use the order number the customer already provided. This creates unnecessary back-and-forth instead of taking immediate action.\",\n",
    "  'satisfied': \"false\"  # ❌ Judge says this response is unsatisfactory\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Result: Only 40% of baseline responses are rated as satisfactory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 1: Load Optimized Judge & Development Data**\n",
    "1. **Load optimized judge** from Notebook 03 that reliably evaluates support quality\n",
    "2. **Load development dataset** (conversations needing response generation)\n",
    "3. **Configure baseline generator** (GPT-3.5-turbo for response generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Development Data Structure:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dev_example = {\n",
    "  'conversation_id': 'Session:2057187615:12852',\n",
    "  'input_transcript': '''Company: Southwest Airlines\n",
    "Transcript so far: Customer: i just booked my flight and i have received a email but im not sure if it went through or not, i cant go to the web site and see my itinerary\n",
    "Agent: Hello! I understand your concern about your flight booking. Let me help you verify your reservation.\n",
    "Customer: The email just says payment received with an order number, no confirmation code''',\n",
    "  # Goal: Generate better next agent response\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 2: Baseline Generator Evaluation**\n",
    "4. **Generate baseline responses** using unoptimized GPT-3.5-turbo\n",
    "5. **Evaluate with optimized judge** to establish baseline performance\n",
    "6. **Identify failure patterns** where responses are rated unsatisfactory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baseline Generator Configuration:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "baseline_generator = dspy.ChainOfThought(SupportTranscriptNextResponse)\n",
    "# Signature: transcript → next_response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baseline Evaluation Results:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Baseline Response Generation\n",
    "baseline_response = '''Agent: I can help you check your booking status. Can you please provide me with your booking reference number or the email address you used for the reservation?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "# Judge Evaluation: 40% satisfaction rate\n",
    "# Problem: Generic responses that don't leverage available information\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 3: Generator Optimization Using Optimized Judge**\n",
    "7. **Use optimized judge as evaluation metric** for generator training\n",
    "8. **Apply MIPROv2 optimization** to improve response generation prompts\n",
    "9. **Create optimized generator** that produces judge-approved responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**What MIPROv2 Does for Generator:**\n",
    "1. **Identifies Poor Responses**: Finds examples where baseline generator creates responses rated \"false\" by judge\n",
    "2. **Analyzes Response Patterns**: Discovers that baseline is too generic and doesn't use available context\n",
    "3. **Generates Better Prompts**: Creates instructions for more proactive, context-aware responses\n",
    "4. **Tests Variations**: Evaluates multiple prompt candidates using judge as evaluation metric\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimized Generator Result:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Input: Same customer conversation\n",
    "conversation = '''Company: Southwest Airlines\n",
    "Transcript so far: Customer: i just booked my flight...\n",
    "Customer: The email just says payment received with an order number, no confirmation code'''\n",
    "\n",
    "# Optimized GPT-3.5-turbo Response (after MIPROv2)\n",
    "optimized_response = '''Agent: I can look up your booking with the order number you mentioned. Can you please provide that order number along with your full name? This will allow me to locate your reservation and provide you with your confirmation code immediately.'''\n",
    "\n",
    "# Optimized Judge Evaluation\n",
    "judge_evaluation = {\n",
    "  'reasoning': \"The agent proactively used the information provided by the customer (order number) and clearly explained how this will solve their problem. This demonstrates attentive listening and provides a clear path to resolution.\",\n",
    "  'satisfied': \"true\"  # ✅ Judge approves optimized response\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Improved Performance: 75% of optimized responses rated as satisfactory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 4: Performance Validation & Comparison**\n",
    "10. **Evaluate optimized generator** against baseline using judge metric\n",
    "11. **Compare satisfaction rates** before and after optimization\n",
    "12. **Validate on unseen examples** to ensure generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Comparison:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Baseline Generator (GPT-3.5 unoptimized):     40% satisfaction rate\n",
    "Optimized Generator (GPT-3.5 + MIPROv2):      75% satisfaction rate\n",
    "Improvement: 35 percentage point increase in customer satisfaction\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **Key Innovation: Judge-Guided Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Optimization Loop**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Step 1: Generator creates response\n",
    "response = generator(conversation)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Judge evaluates response quality  \n",
    "evaluation = optimized_judge(conversation + response)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: MIPROv2 learns from judge feedback\n",
    "# If evaluation.satisfied == \"false\":\n",
    "#   - Analyze what made this response poor\n",
    "#   - Generate better prompts for similar situations\n",
    "#   - Test improved prompts on validation set\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why This Works**\n",
    "- **Reliable Evaluation**: Optimized judge (85% accuracy vs expert) provides consistent feedback\n",
    "- **Automated Improvement**: MIPROv2 learns patterns from judge evaluations\n",
    "- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Generator optimization guided by judge optimization\n",

    "### **Multi-Model Architecture:**\n",
    "- **Generator**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo (the model we're optimizing)\n",
    "- **Judge**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash (wrapped with `ModuleWithLM` to maintain its context)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **DSPy's Global Context System:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "generate_model = dspy.LM(\n",
    "    \"openai/gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n",
    "    api_key=secrets[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"],\n",

    "dspy.configure(lm=generate_model, track_usage=True, adapter=dspy.JSONAdapter())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What This Accomplishes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sets Global Default**: All DSPy operations will use GPT-3.5-turbo by default\n",
    "2. **Generator Context**: When MIPROv2 optimizes `generate_response`, it uses this global context\n",
    "3. **Usage Tracking**: `track_usage=True` monitors token consumption during optimization\n",
    "4. **JSON Adapter**: Ensures consistent response parsing across optimization iterations\n",
    "5. **Temperature Control**: `temperature=0` for deterministic optimization behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works with the Judge:**\n",
    "- **Generator**: Uses the global context (GPT-3.5-turbo)\n",
    "- **Judge**: The `ModuleWithLM` wrapper **overrides** this global context temporarily to use Gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Without This Setup:**\n",
    "If we didn't configure the global context, DSPy would either:\n",
    "- Use whatever model was configured previously\n",
    "- Default to an undefined state\n",
    "- Apply inconsistent settings during optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that **during MIPROv2 optimization**, the generator consistently uses GPT-3.5-turbo while the judge maintains its Gemini context through the wrapper."

    "## What Does \"Optimized generator result = false\" Mean? ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see `Optimized generator result = false` in the analysis output, it reveals **cases where optimization made things worse**. Here's what this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔍 Context of This Analysis:**\n",
    "The code examines `switched_results` - conversations where the judge's verdict **changed** between baseline and optimized versions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "switched_results = combined_result[baseline_satisfied != optimized_satisfied]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **📉 \"Optimized generator result = false\" Indicates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression Cases**: Conversations where:\n",
    "- **Baseline response**: Judge rated as `satisfied = \"true\"` ✅\n",
    "- **Optimized response**: Judge rated as `satisfied = \"false\"` ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**What This Reveals:**\n",
    "1. **Optimization Trade-offs**: The generator learned new patterns that improved some responses but broke others\n",
    "2. **Unintended Consequences**: While fixing certain problems, optimization introduced new issues\n",
    "3. **Quality Degradation**: Specific conversations where the optimized generator performed worse than baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔬 What to Look For in These Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baseline Response Analysis:**\n",
    "- What made the baseline response satisfactory?\n",
    "- What qualities did it have that worked well?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimized Response Problems:**\n",
    "- What went wrong in the optimized version?\n",
    "- Did it become too generic/specific?\n",
    "- Did it lose empathy/context awareness?\n",
    "- Did it ignore important conversation details?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Judge's Reasoning:**\n",
    "- **Baseline critique**: Why the original response was good\n",
    "- **Optimized critique**: Why the new response failed\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🎯 Strategic Importance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Net Impact Assessment:**\n",
    "- Count of `result = false` vs `result = true` cases\n",
    "- Are improvements outweighing regressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Recognition:**\n",
    "- Common failure modes in regressed responses\n",
    "- Types of conversations where optimization struggles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization Refinement:**\n",
    "- Areas where the optimization approach needs adjustment\n",
    "- Whether the judge metric needs tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔧 Example Interpretation:**\n",
    "If you see several `Optimized generator result = false` cases, it might indicate that while the generator learned to handle some difficult situations better, it lost some of the natural, empathetic qualities that made baseline responses effective in straightforward cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis helps you understand both the **benefits and costs** of the optimization process!"
