    "# Notebook 02: Gold Standard Labels Generation for Judge Training\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 **Overview**\n",
    "This notebook generates **gold standard labels** for training DSPy judges by using Claude 4.5 Sonnet as a \"Subject Matter Expert\" (SME) to evaluate customer support conversations. It creates human-quality judgments that will serve as ground truth labels for optimizing our DSPy judge in Notebook 03.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 **Complete Workflow with Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing from Notebooks 00-01, let's trace how our flight booking conversation becomes a labeled training example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Starting Point (from Notebook 01)**\n",
    "We begin with the structured training data from Notebook 01's output:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Example Structure:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "  'conversation_id': 'Session:2057187615:12852',\n",
    "  'conversation': \"Customer: i just booked my flight...\",  # Original full conversation\n",
    "  'truncated_conversation': \"Customer: i just booked...\",   # Incomplete scenario  \n",
    "  'company_and_transcript': \"Company: Southwest Airlines\\nTranscript so far: Customer: i just booked my flight...\",\n",
    "  'llm_response': \"Thank you for providing that information. I found your booking!...\",  # Baseline response\n",
    "  'output_transcript': \"Company: Southwest Airlines\\nTranscript so far: Customer: i just booked my flight and i have received a email but im not sure if it went through or not, i cant go to the web site and see my itinerary\\nAgent: Hello! I understand your concern...\\nSupport: Thank you for providing that information. I found your booking! Your confirmation code is ABC123.\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 1: Test Dataset Selection**\n",
    "1. **Load train/test splits** from `datasets/preprocessed_dev_judge_dataset_split/`\n",
    "2. **Use test split** for gold standard generation (20 examples)\n",
    "3. **Extract conversation transcripts** with complete agent responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Flight Booking Example becomes:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input for Gold Standard Judge:\n",
    "Company: Southwest Airlines\n",
    "Transcript so far: Customer: i just booked my flight and i have received a email but im not sure if it went through or not, i cant go to the web site and see my itinerary\n",
    "Agent: Hello! I understand your concern about your flight booking. Let me help you verify your reservation.\n",
    "Customer: The email just says payment received with an order number, no confirmation code\n",
    "Agent: I can look up your booking with the order number. Can you provide that along with your full name?\n",
    "Customer: Order #12345, John Smith\n",
    "Support: Thank you for providing that information. I found your booking! Your confirmation code is ABC123. Your flight is confirmed for tomorrow at 2:30 PM.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 2: Gold Standard Judge Setup**\n",
    "4. **Configure Claude 4.5 Sonnet** as expert judge with `SupportTranscriptJudge` signature\n",
    "5. **Use DSPy ChainOfThought** for structured reasoning and judgment\n",
    "6. **Set temperature=0** for consistent, deterministic judgments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Judge Configuration:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dspy_config = {\n",
    "    \"model_name\": \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",  # Latest Claude 4.5 Sonnet\n",
    "    \"api_key\": secrets[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"],\n",
    "    \"temperature\": 0  # Deterministic judgments\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "judge = dspy.ChainOfThought(SupportTranscriptJudge)\n",
    "# Signature: transcript (input) → reasoning + satisfied (outputs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 3: Expert Evaluation**\n",
    "7. **Process each transcript** through Claude for expert evaluation\n",
    "8. **Generate reasoning** explaining the satisfaction judgment\n",
    "9. **Produce binary labels** (True/False) for customer satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Gold Standard Evaluation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Input to Claude\n",
    "transcript = \"Company: Southwest Airlines\\nTranscript so far: Customer: i just booked my flight...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Claude's Expert Judgment\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"reasoning\": \"The agent successfully resolved the customer's booking concern by locating the reservation and providing the confirmation code. The customer's initial worry about whether the booking went through was addressed completely, and flight details were confirmed.\",\n",
    "  \"satisfied\": \"true\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 4: Gold Standard Dataset Creation**\n",
    "10. **Extract structured labels** from Claude's responses\n",
    "11. **Save gold standard dataset** to `datasets/gold_standard_judge_result/`\n",
    "12. **Create training examples** for DSPy judge optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Gold Standard Structure:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "  'conversation_id': 'Session:2057187615:12852',\n",
    "  'output_transcript': \"Company: Southwest Airlines\\nTranscript so far...\",\n",
    "  'dspy_response': {\n",
    "    'reasoning': \"The agent successfully resolved the customer's booking concern...\",\n",
    "    'satisfied': \"true\"  \n",
    "  },\n",
    "  'explanation': \"The agent successfully resolved the customer's booking concern...\",  # Extracted\n",
    "  'satisfied': \"true\"  # Extracted for easy access\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **Key Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **SupportTranscriptJudge Signature**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SupportTranscriptJudge(dspy.Signature):\n",
    "    transcript: str = dspy.InputField(desc=\"Input transcript to judge\")\n",
    "    satisfied: str = dspy.OutputField(desc=\"Whether the agent satisfied the customer query. This must be either True or False\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Claude 4.5 Sonnet as SME**\n",
    "- **Expert-level reasoning**: Provides human-quality judgment explanations\n",
    "- **Consistent evaluation**: Temperature=0 ensures reproducible labels\n",
    "- **Binary satisfaction**: Clear True/False labels for optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "### **ChainOfThought Processing**\n",
    "- **Structured reasoning**: Forces Claude to explain its judgment\n",
    "- **Quality assurance**: Reasoning helps validate label correctness\n",
    "- **Training richness**: Provides examples of good evaluation logic\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 **Data Flow Transformation**\n",
    "1. **Training Examples** (Notebook 01) → **Selected Test Cases** (Phase 1)\n",
    "2. **Test Conversations** → **Expert Judgments** (Phase 3)\n",
    "3. **Claude Evaluations** → **Gold Standard Labels** (Phase 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📁 **File Organization**\n",
    "- **Input**: `datasets/preprocessed_dev_judge_dataset_split/test/` (20 examples from Notebook 01)\n",
    "- **Output**: `datasets/gold_standard_judge_result/` (labeled training data)\n",
    "- **Model**: Claude 4.5 Sonnet via Anthropic API\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 **Pipeline Integration**\n",
    "This notebook serves as the **ground truth generation phase**:\n",
    "- **Consumes**: Structured training examples from Notebook 01\n",
    "- **Produces**: Expert-labeled satisfaction judgments\n",
    "- **Enables**: Judge optimization in Notebook 03 with high-quality training data\n",
    "- **Quality**: Claude 4.5 Sonnet provides human-level evaluation quality\n",
    "\n",
    "The gold standard labels become the \"correct answers\" that teach our DSPy judge how to properly evaluate customer support conversations!"
