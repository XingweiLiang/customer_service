    "# Notebook 01: Dataset Preparation and Baseline Response Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 **Overview**\n",
    "This notebook transforms the **synthetic conversations from Notebook 00** into structured training examples for DSPy judge optimization. It creates truncated conversation scenarios and generates baseline agent responses that will be used to train and evaluate our DSPy judge in subsequent notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 **Complete Workflow with Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing from Notebook 00's output, let's walk through the data transformation process using the same flight booking conversation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Starting Point (from Notebook 00)**\n",
    "We begin with the complete synthetic conversation that was generated from this original input:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original Input:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Text: \"Customer: i just booked my flight and i have received a email but im not sure if it went through or not, i cant go to the web site and see my itinerary\"\n",
    "Number of words: 34\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generated Full Conversation (Notebook 00 output):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Company: Southwest Airlines\n",
    "Conversation:\n",
    "Customer: i just booked my flight and i have received a email but im not sure if it went through or not, i cant go to the web site and see my itinerary\n",
    "Agent: Hello! I understand your concern about your flight booking. Let me help you verify your reservation.\n",
    "Customer: The email just says payment received with an order number, no confirmation code\n",
    "Agent: I can look up your booking with the order number. Can you provide that along with your full name?\n",
    "Customer: Order #12345, John Smith\n",
    "Agent: Found your booking! Your confirmation code is ABC123. Your flight is confirmed for tomorrow at 2:30 PM from Boston to Chicago.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 1: Data Loading & Preprocessing**\n",
    "1. **Load synthetic conversations** from `datasets/airline_support_conversations` (generated in Notebook 00)\n",
    "2. **Preprocess data** to standardize format and extract key fields\n",
    "3. **Sample conversations** for baseline generation (400 examples)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 2: Conversation Truncation**\n",
    "4. **Truncate conversations** using `ConversationTruncator` to create incomplete scenarios\n",
    "5. **Ensure customer speaks last** to set up response generation context\n",
    "6. **Preserve conversation context** while creating natural stopping points\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Transformation:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original: 8 turns (4 customer + 4 agent messages)\n",
    "Truncated: 6 turns (ending with customer message)\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncated Conversation:\n",
    "Customer: i just booked my flight and i have received a email but im not sure if it went through or not, i cant go to the web site and see my itinerary\n",
    "Agent: Hello! I understand your concern about your flight booking. Let me help you verify your reservation.\n",
    "Customer: The email just says payment received with an order number, no confirmation code\n",
    "Agent: I can look up your booking with the order number. Can you provide that along with your full name?\n",
    "Customer: Order #12345, John Smith\n",
    "[TRUNCATED - Agent response needed]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 3: Baseline Response Generation**\n",
    "7. **Generate baseline agent responses** using DSPy ChainOfThought with GPT-3.5-turbo\n",
    "8. **Create company_and_transcript field** combining company context with conversation\n",
    "9. **Process in parallel** for efficient baseline generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input to Baseline Model:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Company: Southwest Airlines\n",
    "Transcript so far:\n",
    "Customer: i just booked my flight and i have received a email but im not sure if it went through or not, i cant go to the web site and see my itinerary\n",
    "Agent: Hello! I understand your concern about your flight booking. Let me help you verify your reservation.\n",
    "Customer: The email just says payment received with an order number, no confirmation code\n",
    "Agent: I can look up your booking with the order number. Can you provide that along with your full name?\n",
    "Customer: Order #12345, John Smith\n",
    "\n",
    "What should the agent respond next?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generated Baseline Response:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Found your booking! Your confirmation code is ABC123. Your flight is confirmed for tomorrow at 2:30 PM from Boston to Chicago.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 4: Dataset Organization & Splitting**\n",
    "10. **Calculate response metrics** (word count, readability score)\n",
    "11. **Create train/test splits** (60% train, 40% test)\n",
    "12. **Save structured datasets** for use in judge optimization (Notebooks 02-03)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Dataset Structure:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "  'conversation': \"Customer: i just booked...\",  # Original full conversation\n",
    "  'truncated_conversation': \"Customer: i just...\",  # Incomplete scenario\n",
    "  'company_and_transcript': \"Company: Southwest Airlines\\nTranscript...\",  # Input format\n",
    "  'llm_response': \"Found your booking! Your confirmation...\",  # Baseline response\n",
    "  'dspy_response': {...},  # DSPy module output with metadata\n",
    "  'count_words_response': 15,  # Response length metric\n",
    "  'output_readability': 85.2  # Flesch reading ease score\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **Key Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **ConversationTruncator**\n",
    "- Creates incomplete conversation scenarios by randomly truncating at customer messages\n",
    "- Configurable parameters: `min_turns=1`, `ensure_customer_last=True`\n",
    "- Preserves conversation flow while creating realistic stopping points\n",
    "\n",
    "### **DSPy ChainOfThought Baseline**\n",
    "- Uses `SupportTranscriptNextResponse` signature for structured generation\n",
    "- Temperature=1.0 for diverse response generation\n",
    "- Processes company context + conversation history → agent response\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Flow Transformation**\n",
    "1. **Synthetic Conversations** (Notebook 00) → **Truncated Scenarios** (Phase 2)\n",
    "2. **Truncated Scenarios** → **Baseline Responses** (Phase 3) \n",
    "3. **Training Examples** → **Judge Optimization** (Notebooks 02-03)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📁 **File Organization**\n",
    "- **Input**: `datasets/airline_support_conversations` (from Notebook 00)\n",
    "- **Output**: `datasets/preprocessed_dev_judge_dataset_split` (train/test splits)\n",
    "- **Intermediate**: `datasets/preprocessed_full_dataset_truncated` (truncated conversations)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 **Pipeline Integration**\n",
    "This notebook bridges the **data generation phase** (Notebook 00) and the **judge optimization phase** (Notebooks 02-03):\n",
    "- Takes synthetic conversations as input\n",
    "- Produces structured training examples as output\n",
    "- Provides baseline agent responses for comparison\n",
    "- Creates evaluation datasets for judge performance measurement"
