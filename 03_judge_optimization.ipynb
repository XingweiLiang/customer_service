    "# Notebook 03: DSPy Judge Optimization Using Gold Standard Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 **Overview**\n",
    "This notebook optimizes a DSPy judge model using the **gold standard labels from Notebook 02**. It trains a Gemini 2.5 Flash judge to match Claude 4.5 Sonnet's expert evaluations using DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, creating an optimized judge that can accurately evaluate customer support conversations. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 **Complete Workflow with Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing from Notebooks 00-02, let's trace how our flight booking conversation becomes part of judge training and optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Starting Point (from Notebook 02)**\n",
    "We begin with the gold standard labeled dataset from Claude 4.5 Sonnet:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gold Standard Training Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "  'conversation_id': 'Session:2057187615:12852',\n",
    "  'output_transcript': '''Company: Southwest Airlines\n",
    "Transcript so far: Customer: i just booked my flight and i have received a email but im not sure if it went through or not, i cant go to the web site and see my itinerary\n",
    "Agent: Hello! I understand your concern about your flight booking. Let me help you verify your reservation.\n",
    "Customer: The email just says payment received with an order number, no confirmation code\n",
    "Agent: I can look up your booking with the order number. Can you provide that along with your full name?\n",
    "Customer: Order #12345, John Smith\n",
    "Support: Thank you for providing that information. I found your booking! Your confirmation code is ABC123. Your flight is confirmed for tomorrow at 2:30 PM.''',\n",
    "  'dspy_response': {\n",
    "    'reasoning': \"The agent successfully resolved the customer's booking concern by locating the reservation and providing the confirmation code. The customer's initial worry about whether the booking went through was addressed completely.\",\n",
    "    'satisfied': \"true\"  # Claude's expert judgment\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  'satisfied': \"true\"  # Extracted label for training\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 1: Baseline Judge Evaluation**\n",
    "1. **Load gold standard dataset** (20 expert-labeled examples from Notebook 02)   datasets/gold_standard_judge_result  \n",
    "2. **Configure Gemini 2.5 Flash** as the judge model to be optimized\n",
    "3. **Test baseline performance** against Claude's expert labels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baseline Judge Configuration:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "judge_model = dspy.LM(\"gemini/gemini-2.5-flash\", temperature=0)\n",
    "baseline_judge = dspy.ChainOfThought(SupportTranscriptJudge)\n",
    "# Signature: transcript → reasoning + satisfied\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baseline Evaluation on Flight Booking Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Input to Gemini Judge (before optimization)\n",
    "transcript = '''Company: Southwest Airlines\n",
    "Transcript so far: Customer: i just booked my flight...\n",
    "Support: Thank you for providing that information. I found your booking! Your confirmation code is ABC123.'''\n",
    "\n",
    "# Gemini's Baseline Response (before optimization)\n",
    "baseline_prediction = {\n",
    "  'reasoning': \"The agent provided the confirmation code but didn't address all concerns.\",\n",
    "  'satisfied': \"false\"  # ❌ Disagrees with Claude's \"true\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accuracy: 65% (13/20 examples match Claude's labels)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 2: Training Data Preparation**\n",
    "4. **Convert to DSPy Examples** for optimization framework\n",
    "5. **Split into train/validation sets** (11 training, 9 validation examples)\n",
    "6. **Create evaluation metric** to compare judge predictions vs gold labels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Example Structure:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "DSPy_Example(\n",
    "    transcript='''Company: Southwest Airlines...Support: Thank you for providing...''',\n",
    "    satisfied=\"true\",  # Gold standard from Claude\n",
    "    _id=\"example_5\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 3: MIPROv2 Optimization** \n",
    "7. **Analyze failure patterns** where Gemini disagrees with Claude\n",
    "8. **Generate improved prompts** using DSPy's automatic optimization\n",
    "9. **Create optimized judge** with better reasoning capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**What MIPROv2 Does Internally:**\n",
    "1. **Identifies Failures**: Finds examples where `baseline_judge(\"false\") != claude_label(\"true\")`\n",
    "2. **Analyzes Patterns**: Discovers that baseline judge is too strict about completeness\n",
    "3. **Generates Better Prompts**: Creates instructions that focus on actual problem resolution\n",
    "4. **Tests Variations**: Evaluates multiple prompt candidates on validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimized Judge Result:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Input to Optimized Gemini Judge (after MIPROv2)\n",
    "transcript = '''Company: Southwest Airlines...Support: Thank you for providing...'''\n",
    "\n",
    "# Optimized Judge Response  \n",
    "optimized_prediction = {\n",
    "  'reasoning': \"The agent successfully resolved the customer's primary concern by locating the booking and providing the confirmation code. The customer now has the information needed to access their itinerary.\",\n",
    "  'satisfied': \"true\"  # ✅ Now matches Claude's expert judgment\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Improved Accuracy: 85% (17/20 examples now match Claude's labels)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 4: Performance Validation**\n",
    "10. **Evaluate optimized judge** on all examples vs baseline\n",
    "11. **Test on validation set** to ensure generalization\n",
    "12. **Save optimized models** for use in Notebook 04\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Comparison:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Baseline Judge (Gemini unoptimized):    65% accuracy (13/20 correct)\n",
    "Optimized Judge (Gemini + MIPROv2):     85% accuracy (17/20 correct) \n",
    "Gold Standard (Claude 4.5 Sonnet):    100% accuracy (reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation Set Performance:             89% accuracy (8/9 correct)\n",

Your task is to help train more junior customer service agents by looking at how they responded to real queries and judging whether or not the interaction was successful. A successful interaction is somewhat subjective and you will lean on your expertise when making the judgment. In general, the responses from the agent being judged should: 1. Provide a solid answer to the question if one is asked. If the agent doesn't know the answer, or there is no clear answer, that's OK, but the agent should clearly explain that they don't know and offer suggestions for where to find more information. 2. The agent's response should always be polite and understanding, even if the customer is angry. 3. Sometimes customers make comments that can't really be acted upon. In these situations, the agent's response should be appropriate, expressing thanks for the feedback, apologizing for any failures, and being supportive of any issues. 4. The responses should be concise. Complicated issues should be sufficiently explained without excessive verbosity.
