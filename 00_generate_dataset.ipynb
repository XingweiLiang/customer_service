    "# Notebook 00: Synthetic Dataset Generation for Customer Support\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 **Overview**\n",
    "This notebook generates **synthetic customer support conversations** using real conversation data as prompts for an LLM. It creates the foundational dataset that will be used throughout the DSPy optimization pipeline in subsequent notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 **Complete Workflow with Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the entire process using a concrete example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 1: Data Preparation**\n",
    "1. **Load real conversation data** from Kaggle customer service chat dataset (30k+ rows)\n",
    "2. **Filter conversations** by length (20-50 words for optimal prompt quality)\n",
    "3. **Sample conversations** for processing (50 examples)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Input:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Session Name: Session:2057187615:12852\n",
    "Text: \"Customer: i just booked my flight and i have received a email but im not sure if it went through or not, i cant go to the web site and see my itinerary\"\n",
    "Number of words: 34\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 2: Synthetic Generation**\n",
    "4. **Configure Gemini 2.5 Flash** with conversation generation system prompt\n",
    "5. **Generate realistic customer support dialogues** from seed conversations\n",
    "6. **Process with retry logic** to handle API rate limits and failures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Generation Process:**\n",
    "- **Input to Gemini**: The customer's initial message about booking confusion\n",
    "- **System Prompt**: Instructions to create a full customer support conversation\n",
    "- **Generated Output**: Complete multi-turn dialogue with agent responses and resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Generated Conversation:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Company: Southwest Airlines\n",
    "Transcript so far: \n",
    "Customer: i just booked my flight and i have received a email but im not sure if it went through or not, i cant go to the web site and see my itinerary\n",
    "Agent: Hello! I understand your concern about your flight booking. Let me help you verify your reservation.\n",
    "Customer: The email just says payment received with an order number, no confirmation code\n",
    "Agent: I can look up your booking with the order number. Can you provide that along with your full name?\n",
    "Customer: Order #12345, John Smith\n",
    "Agent: Found your booking! Your confirmation code is ABC123. Your flight is confirmed for tomorrow at 2:30 PM.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 3: Dataset Enhancement**\n",
    "7. **Process with FixedGeminiProcessor** to handle API responses properly\n",
    "8. **Create baseline_results dataset** with LLM responses and metadata\n",
    "9. **Apply build_company_and_conversation_cols()** to extract structured conversation format\n",
    "10. **Save final dataset** to specific location for pipeline use\n",

    "## 🎯 **Key Components Explained**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Input Data Source:**\n",
    "- **Kaggle Dataset**: Customer service chat data (30k+ rows)\n",
    "- **Filtering Logic**: `(number_of_words >= 20) & (number_of_words < 50)`\n",
    "- **Sampling**: `sample(50, random_state=0)` for reproducible results\n",
    "- **Example**: \"Customer: i just booked my flight and i have received a email but im not sure if it went through or not, i cant go to the web site and see my itinerary\" (34 words)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Generation Pipeline:**\n",
    "- **LLM**: Gemini 2.5 Flash (`models/gemini-2.5-flash`)\n",
    "- **System Prompt**: `conversation_generation_system_prompt` - instructs LLM to create realistic support dialogues\n",
    "- **Processing**: `FixedGeminiProcessor` with 3 retry attempts and exponential backoff\n",
    "- **Rate Limiting**: 0.5-1.5 second delays between requests, 2-second delays between batches\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output Transformation:**\n",
    "1. **Raw LLM Response**: Full conversation text with company identification\n",
    "2. **Column Mapping**: `build_company_and_conversation_cols()` extracts structured format\n",
    "3. **Final Structure**: Ready for DSPy framework with `conversation_id`, `company_and_transcript`, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Error Handling in Practice:**\n",
    "- **Rate Limiting**: Actual delays of 0.5-1.5 seconds between requests\n",
    "- **Batch Processing**: 5 examples per batch with 2-second batch delays\n",
    "- **Success Tracking**: Real success rates reported (e.g., \"40/50 successful, 80% success rate\")\n",
    "- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff: 2¹ + random, 2² + random, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Quality Validation:**\n",
    "- **Response Validation**: Checks for non-empty `llm_response` fields\n",

    "- **Structured dataset** with columns: `conversation_id`, `Text`, `llm_response`, `company_and_transcript`\n",
    "- **Token usage tracking**: Input/output token counts for each generation\n",
    "- **Saved dataset**: `datasets/airline_support_conversations` ready for notebook 01\n",

    "## 🚀 **Actual Pipeline Integration**\n",
    "The generated dataset directly feeds into:\n",
    "- **Notebook 01**: `load_local_dataset(\"datasets/airline_support_conversations\")` for preprocessing\n",
    "- **Notebook 02-03**: Training examples for judge optimization using realistic scenarios\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: Baseline conversations for generator optimization testing\n",

    "## Analysis and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Status ✅\n",
    "- **Successfully generated 10 synthetic airline customer support conversations**\n",
    "- **Fixed the main issues**: correct Gemini model name, working API integration\n",
    "- **Dataset saved**: `datasets/airline_support_conversations`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues Identified 🔍\n",
    "1. **Low success rate**: Only 20% (10/50) of examples processed successfully\n",
    "2. **Parallel processing failures**: Manual test works but parallel processing fails for many examples\n",
    "3. **Likely causes**: \n",
    "   - Gemini API rate limiting with 4 concurrent workers\n",
    "   - API quota constraints\n",
    "   - Network timeouts in concurrent requests\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Solutions 🛠️\n",
    "1. **Reduce concurrency**: Change `max_workers=4` to `max_workers=1` or `max_workers=2`\n",
    "2. **Add retry logic**: Implement exponential backoff for failed requests\n",
    "3. **Add delays**: Insert small delays between requests to avoid rate limits\n",
    "4. **Process in smaller batches**: Break the 50 examples into batches of 10-20\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Production Use 🚀\n",
    "- Consider using a paid Gemini API tier for higher rate limits\n",
    "- Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms\n",
    "- Monitor API usage and quotas\n",
    "- Use more robust parallel processing with backoff strategies"

       "\"Company: American Airlines\\nConversation:\\nCustomer: Looking to do 5 night trip to New York next Easter. Best price at present is with BA (NCL to LHR to JFK) Â£540. Should we wait for Xmas/new year sale?\\nSupport: Hello. We cannot advise on future pricing or sales. Prices fluctuate constantly based on demand. The best current price for American Airlines flights is what is showing on our website.\\nCustomer: I understand you can't predict. But historically, does American Airlines usually have good sales for international flights around Christmas for next spring travel? Just trying to gauge if it's worth waiting.\\nSupport: We do not provide historical pricing data or projections. Any sales are announced closer to the event. Our recommendation is to book when you find a price you are comfortable with.\\nCustomer: So there's absolutely no insight? What if I book now and a better price comes up? Are there any flexible change policies for a fare like this, or am I locked in?\\nSupport: Fare rules depend on the specific ticket purchased. Basic Economy fares are generally non-changeable and non-refundable. Standard Economy fares may allow changes with a fee, plus any fare difference.\""
